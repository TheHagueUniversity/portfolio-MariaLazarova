                    <p>As I started working in the <b>"Hladky It"</b>company, </p>
                    <p>the first thing I created was a new way of working process.</p>
                    <p>I had to focus on the user experience form two aspects:</p>
                    <li>the company's point of view</li>
                    <li> the client's point of view</li>
                    <p>First, I did some research on the clients, the contracts that we are using with them 
                       and everything that needs to be done. After this, it was time to make the process of contract signing and workshop arranging 
                       way more efficient. I did some research on what are the clients most complaining about the contract signing process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, the problem within the company was that the process for them took too much time and effort, time that they could have used 
                        for many more interesting and entertaining for them activites. Doing a research on that helped me realize what their
                        needs are and how we can solve the problem.
                    </p>
                    <p> With both research combined, I manage to create a full customer care and business process
                        that made both the clients and the comapny happier.
