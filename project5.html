                        "Our mission is to provide developers with the things they need and love. 
                        We inspire, entertain, motivate and educate developers. 
                        We give developers a voice and we connect them with each other.
                        We give developers visibility and attention. 
                        We provide them with opportunities and help them grow."

                        These events allow for people to network, to learn and to attend 
                        different talks and workshops.
                        What's more, being part of the organization and the crew gave me the opportunity to
                        observe people's behaviour during the event, what they enjoy and what makes it so exciting for them.
