                        The internet and social media provide young people with a range of benefits, and opportunities to empower themselves in a variety of ways. 
                        Young people can maintain social connections and support networks that otherwise wouldn't be possible,
                        and can access more information than ever before. 
                        The communities and social interactions young people 
                        form online can be invaluable for bolstering and 
                        developing young people's self-confidence and 
                        social skills.

                       The goal of this project is to connect the incoming students in the Hague Univeristy
                       of Applied Sciences with the already enrolled ones. It is important for the future students
                       to feel comfortable and to know more about the atmosphere and the vibe
                       of the studies. This is way the social media pages of the study are organized and maintained
                       by other students in the course.

                        Being part of the social media team of the course teaches us how to work together,
                        what are the important aspects of social media content, how to be consistant and also, it is fun.
                        We participate in many additional activities so we can share them with the students.
